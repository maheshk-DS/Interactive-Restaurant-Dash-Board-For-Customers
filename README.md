# Interactive-Restaurant-Dash-Board-For-Customers
Restaurant Dashboard was established for foodie consumers to help them find the best cuisine, dish, and  restaurant type based on their ratings. A dashboard is a graphical user interface that shows key performance  indicators (KPIs) for a particular goal or business activity. For a better data management procedure, a  MySQL database is linked to the Tableau BI tool.
